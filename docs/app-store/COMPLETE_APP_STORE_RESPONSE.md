## Response to Apple Review Team

Dear Apple Review Team,

Thank you for your comprehensive feedback on our app submission. We have addressed all the issues raised in your review. Here's a detailed response to each guideline:

### **Guideline 2.1 - Performance - App Completeness** ‚úÖ

#### **Issue 1: Google Sign-In Crash**
**Problem:** App crashed when tapping "Continue with Google"

**Root Cause:** Missing Android client ID configuration and platform-specific error handling

**Fixes Applied:**
1. **Added Android Client ID:** Uncommented and configured `androidClientId` in Google Sign-In service
2. **Platform-Specific Handling:** Added iOS/Android specific checks for Google Play Services
3. **Enhanced Error Handling:** Added comprehensive logging and error handling to prevent crashes
4. **Better User Feedback:** Improved error messages for users

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Added Android client ID configuration
androidClientId: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID || '933970195369-dreapndpfibqgqmr54a662hjaliv4j7l.apps.googleusercontent.com',

// Platform-specific Google Play Services check
if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
  await GoogleSignin.hasPlayServices({
    showPlayServicesUpdateDialog: true,
  });
}
```

#### **Issue 2: Apple Sign-In Error** ‚úÖ (Previously Fixed)
**Problem:** An error occurred when trying to continue with Apple to login

**Fix:** Changed API endpoint from `/api/v1/auth/oauth/register` to `/api/v1/auth/oauth/apple`

#### **Issue 3: Create Runner Profile Button** ‚úÖ (Previously Fixed)
**Problem:** No action occurred when tapping "Create Runner Profile"

**Fix:** Changed button handler from `setShowCreateRunnerForm(true)` to `handleCreateRunnerProfile()`

### **Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed** ‚úÖ

#### **Safety Incident Reporting Information**
**Question:** "How do users report safety incidents and sightings in the app?"

**Answer:** Users can report safety incidents and sightings through the following steps:

1. **Access Cases:** Users can view active missing person cases from the home screen
2. **Report Sighting:** 
   - Tap on any case to view details
   - Tap "Report Sighting" button
   - Fill out the sighting form with:
     - Location (automatically captured or manually entered)
     - Date and time of sighting
     - Description of what was observed
     - Photos (optional but recommended)
     - Contact information for follow-up
3. **Submit Report:** Tap "Submit Report" to send the information to law enforcement and case administrators
4. **Follow-up:** Users receive confirmation and may be contacted by authorities for additional information

**Additional Safety Features:**
- **Emergency Contact:** All sighting reports include option to contact local law enforcement immediately

### **Guideline 2.3.3 - Performance - Accurate Metadata** ‚úÖ

**Resolution:** We will upload new screenshots that accurately show the app in use, including:
- Login screen with Apple Sign-In and Google Sign-In options
- Home screen showing active cases

- Admin portal (for users with admin access)

**Screenshots will be updated in App Store Connect before resubmission.**

### **Guideline 2.3 - Performance - Accurate Metadata** ‚úÖ

#### **App Description Issues**
**Problem:** App description includes test credentials and irrelevant information

**Resolution:** We have removed the following content from the app description:
- ‚ùå "Test account credentials provided above"
- ‚ùå "The app uses location services for nearby alerts and camera for incident reporting"

**New App Description (Clean Version):**
"241 Runners is a community-driven missing person awareness app that helps bring people home safely. View active missing person cases, report sightings with photos and location data, and receive real-time updates about cases in your area. Join our community of concerned citizens working together to help law enforcement and families find missing persons."

### **Guideline 2.3.6 - Performance - Accurate Metadata** ‚úÖ

#### **Age Rating Issues**
**Problem:** Age rating shows "In-App Controls" but none exist

**Resolution:** We will update the Age Rating in App Store Connect:
- **Parental Controls:** Change from "In-App Controls" to **"None"**
- **Age Assurance:** Change from "In-App Controls" to **"None"**
