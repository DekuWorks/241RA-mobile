# 241 Runners App Icon Setup Guide

## üé® Using Your 241 Runners Awareness Logo

Based on your logo design with the red "241 RUNNERS AWARENESS" text and traffic light/pedestrian icons, here's how to set it up as your app icon.

## üìÅ Current Icon Files

Your app currently uses these placeholder icons:

- `assets/icon.png` - Main app icon
- `assets/adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon
- `assets/favicon.png` - Web favicon
- `assets/splash-icon.png` - Splash screen icon

## üîÑ Replacement Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Logo

1. **Save your logo** as a high-resolution PNG file
2. **Recommended size**: 1024x1024px or larger
3. **Format**: PNG with transparent background (if possible)
4. **Colors**: Keep the red and black design from your logo

### Step 2: Create Required Sizes

#### For iOS (Replace `assets/icon.png`):

```
1024x1024px - App Store icon
180x180px   - iPhone app icon
167x167px   - iPad Pro app icon
152x152px   - iPad app icon
```

#### For Android (Replace `assets/adaptive-icon.png`):

```
512x512px   - Google Play Store icon
192x192px   - Android app icon
144x144px   - Android app icon (mdpi)
216x216px   - Android app icon (xxhdpi)
```

### Step 3: Design Considerations

#### App Icon Requirements:

- **No text** - App icons should work without text (iOS/Android add text separately)
- **Simple design** - Should be recognizable at small sizes
- **High contrast** - Works on light and dark backgrounds
- **No transparency** - iOS requires solid background

#### Suggested Modifications for App Icon:

1. **Use just the traffic light and pedestrian icons** (remove text)
2. **Add "241" as a subtle element** (small, not the main focus)
3. **Keep red and black color scheme**
4. **Ensure it works at 29x29px size** (smallest iOS icon)

### Step 4: Icon Design Options

#### Option A: Traffic Light Focus

- Main element: Traffic light silhouette
- Accent: Small "241" in corner
- Colors: Black traffic light, red "241"

#### Option B: Pedestrian Focus

- Main element: Pedestrian crossing icon
- Accent: Small "241" in corner
- Colors: Black pedestrian, red "241"

#### Option C: Combined Elements

- Traffic light and pedestrian icons together
- "241" integrated into the design
- Maintains brand recognition

### Step 5: Implementation

#### Quick Setup (if you have the logo file):

1. **Save your logo** as `241runners-logo.png`
2. **Place it in the project root** temporarily
3. **Run the setup script** (I'll create this)

#### Manual Setup:

1. **Replace `assets/icon.png`** with your 1024x1024px version
2. **Replace `assets/adaptive-icon.png`** with your 512x512px version
3. **Update splash screen** if needed
4. **Rebuild the app**

## üõ†Ô∏è Automated Icon Generation

I can help you create a script to automatically generate all required sizes from your logo file.

### What I Need:

1. **Your logo file** (high-resolution PNG)
2. **Preferred design approach** (Option A, B, or C above)
3. **Confirmation** to proceed with icon generation

## üì± App Store Optimization

### Icon Best Practices:

- **Distinctive** - Stands out among other apps
- **Memorable** - Easy to recognize and remember
- **Brand consistent** - Matches your 241 Runners brand
- **Scalable** - Works at all required sizes

### Your Logo Advantages:

‚úÖ **High contrast** (red/black on white)
‚úÖ **Simple, recognizable symbols** (traffic light, pedestrian)
‚úÖ **Community-focused** (safety awareness)
‚úÖ **Professional appearance**

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Provide your logo file** (or confirm you want to use the current design)
2. **Choose design approach** for the app icon
3. **Generate all required sizes**
4. **Update app configuration**
5. **Rebuild with new icons**

Would you like me to:

- Create an automated icon generation script?
- Help you modify the current placeholder icons?
- Wait for you to provide the logo file?

The builds are still in progress, so we have time to perfect the app icon before the final production builds!
